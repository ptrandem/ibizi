# iBizi

iBizi is a simple, color-based status indicator via a USB connection.

There are many other projects out there that have similar functionality, but none of them quite had the form factor we were looking for.

The iBizi project also aims to support the hardware with universal Chrome app support, making status changes a breeze.
