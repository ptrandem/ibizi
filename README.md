# ibizi

ibizi is a simple, one-pixel status indicator via a USB connection.

There are many other things out there that have similar functionality, but none of them quite have the form factor we were looking for.

The ibizi project also aims to support the hardware with universal Chrome app support, making status changes a breeze.
